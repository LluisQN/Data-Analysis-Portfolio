# Lluís Quintana - Data Analysis Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Lluís! I have an analytical and quantitative background in Economics and Business and I am on track to completing my M.Sc. in International Economic Consulting. I have developed a passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights, bridging the gap between complex data analytics and non-technical stakeholders. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in machine learnining techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

## Analyzing the characteristics that make a Spotify song popular
**Code:** [What characteristics make a song popular in Spotify?](https://github.com/LluisQN/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Spotify%20popularity.ipynb)
**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of songs from Spotify. The dataset included song popularity score, numbr of tracks in album, danceability, energy, key loudness, mode, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and developing several machine learning methodologies to define which are the most relevant song characteristics to become popular.

## Analyzing the causes of heart disease
**Code:** [What are the main factors contributing to heart disease?](https://github.com/LluisQN/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Predicting%20Heart%20Disease.Rmd)
**Description:** The study will explore key determinants of heart disease, such as demographic factors, lifestyle choices, and pre-existing health conditions. Additionally, depending on the content covered in upcoming classes, alternative methods may be incorporated to ensure a robust and insightful analysis. In recent years, health economics has emerged as a dynamic field of research, gaining increasing attention due to its critical role in shaping healthcare policies and improving the overall well-being of populations. This research project aims to investigate the factors influencing heart disease, using US-American health data of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Survey 2022, provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Specifically, we intend to employ decision trees and random forests to analyze the BRFSS dataset comprehensively and estimate predictors for the different impact factors.
