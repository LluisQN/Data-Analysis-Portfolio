# Lluís Quintana - Data Analysis Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Lluís! I have an analytical and quantitative background in Economics and Business and I am on track to completing my M.Sc. in International Economic Consulting. I have developed a passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights, bridging the gap between complex data analytics and non-technical stakeholders. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in machine learnining techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Analyzing the characteristics that make a Spotify song popular
**Code:** [What characteristics make a song popular in Spotify?](https://github.com/LluisQN/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Spotify%20popularity.ipynb)

The dataset included song popularity score, numbr of tracks in album, danceability, energy, key loudness, mode, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and developing several machine learning methodologies to define which are the most relevant song characteristics to become popular..
